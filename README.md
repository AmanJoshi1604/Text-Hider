# Text-Hider

# PROJECT TITLE/PROBLEM STATEMENT
The former consists of linguistic or language forms of hidden writing. The later, such as invisible ink, try of hide messages physically. One disadvantage of linguistic steganography is that users must equip themselves to have a good knowledge of linguistry. In recent years, everything is trending toward digitization. And with the development of the internet technology, digital media can be transmitted conveniently over the network. Therefore, messages can be secretly carried by digital media by using the steganography techniques, and then be transmitted through the internet rapidly Steganography is the art of hiding the fact that communication is taking place, by hiding information in other information. Many different carrier file formats can be used, but digital images are the most popular because of their frequency on the internet. For hiding secret information in images, there exists a large variety of steganography techniques some are more complex than others and all of them have respective strong and weak points. So we prepare this application, to make the information hiding more simple and user friendly.

# AGENDA
1. The goal of steganography is covert communication. So, a fundamental requirement of this steganography system is that the hider message carried by stego-media should not be sensible to human beings. 
2. The other goad of steganography is to avoid drawing suspicion to the existence of a hidden message. This approach of information hiding technique has recently became important in a number of application area
3.This project has following objectives:
  1. To product security tool based on steganography techniques. 
  2. To explore techniques of hiding data using encryption module of this project 
  3. To extract techniques of getting secret data using decryption module.

# PROJECT  OVERVIEW
1. The main goal of this projects it to communicate securely in a completely undetectable manner and to avoid drawing suspicion to the transmission of a hider data. There has been a rapid growth of interest in steganography for two reasons: 
  1. The publishing and broadcasting industries have become interested in techniques for hiding encrypted copyright marks and serial numbers in digital films, audio recordings, books and multimedia products Moves by various governments to restrict the availability of encryption services have motivated people to study methods by which private messages can be embedded in seemingly innocuous cover messages. 
  2. The basic model of steganography consists of Carrier, Message and password. Carrier is also known as cover-object, which the message is embedded and serves to hide the presence of the message.
Basically, the model for steganography is shown on following figure
